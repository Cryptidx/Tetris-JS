<h1>TETRIS (Vanilla JavaScript) </h1>

<p> To play this game is relatively straightforward. Download the file and open game.html in your web browser </p>
<p> The Instructions for this game are the same for NES Tetris. The beloved game from the 70s! So basically, try not to lose :> </p>
<p> If there are any issues you encountered or suggestions you'd want to give please raise an issue in my repo and I'll attend to it. I hope you enjoy playing
it as much as I did developing it. </p>
